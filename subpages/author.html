          Jossue Daniel is a novelist and a lover of rural life. With a passion
          for literature and sports, he has found writing to be both enjoyable and
          a way to channel his creativity. During the creation of his first book,
          "Henry: Scars and Smiles", his faithful companion was his beloved pet, a
          lovebird named Maggie. Currently, Jossue Daniel is working on his second
          novel, the title of which is still unknown. In this new work, the
          protagonist Charlotte creates an exquisite imaginary world called Ether.
          Within Ether, she and her daughter Esperanza, who transforms into the
          deity Zephyra, seek refuge from the harsh realities faced by those
          grappling with identity and societal acceptance. This narrative
          challenges our views on human rights and parental responsibility,
          infused with elements of cynicism and tragicomedy as we navigate the
          tumultuous waters of obsession.
