          Jossue Daniel is a novelist and a lover of rural life, blending his passions for literature and sports 
          to craft stories that resonate deeply with readers. Writing has always been a channel for his creativity, 
          offering both joy and a meaningful escape. His debut novel, Henry: Scars and Smiles, was completed with 
          the loyal companionship of his beloved pet lovebird, Maggie, an Agapornis roseicollis, who was by his 
          side throughout the writing process.

Jossue brings a diverse skill set to his work, including experience as a Program Manager, legal expertise, 
and web development skills. Outside of his professional life, he volunteers his time to local sports committees, 
contributing to the community and encouraging youth involvement in sports.

Currently, Jossue is working on his second novel, the title of which remains under wraps. In this upcoming work, 
the protagonist, Charlotte, creates a beautiful and intricate imaginary world called Ether. Within Ether, Charlotte 
and her daughter Esperanza, who transforms into the deity Zephyra, seek solace from the harsh realities 
of lifeâ€”particularly those involving struggles with identity and societal acceptance. The narrative invites 
readers to question societal norms surrounding human rights and parental responsibility, while blending cynicism 
and tragicomedy as it delves into the depths of obsession and the human experience.
